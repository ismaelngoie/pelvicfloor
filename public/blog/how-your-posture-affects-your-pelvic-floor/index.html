A simple way to find it is to imagine your ribs are stacked directly over your pelvis, like two bowls balanced on top of each other. Your pubic bone and your two pointy hip bones in the front should form a flat triangle, perpendicular to the floor."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"I have a desk job. What's the best way to sit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Sit with your feet flat on the floor and your hips slightly higher than your knees. Make sure you are sitting on your 'sitz bones' (the bony parts of your bottom), not your tailbone. Keep your shoulders relaxed and your screen at eye level. Most importantly, change positions frequently—the best posture is your next posture."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a tucked-under 'flat back' posture also be bad?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, absolutely. While slouching is common, tucking the tailbone under (posterior pelvic tilt) is also problematic. It shortens the pelvic floor muscles, keeping them in a constantly tensed state which can lead to tightness, pain, and dysfunction."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does wearing high heels affect my pelvic floor?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, significantly. High heels tilt your pelvis forward, forcing your lower back to over-arch and increasing pressure on the front of your pelvic floor and core canister. This can contribute to both leaks and low back pain over time."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to see improvements from correcting my posture?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"While changing a lifelong habit takes time, many people feel an immediate sense of relief from pressure when they find a neutral posture.

Start with short intervals and gradually increase the time as your endurance builds."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Besides sitting and standing, are there other postures I should be aware of?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes.

<p>You’re diligent with your Kegels. You practice your breathing. But at the end of the day, you still struggle with leaks, a feeling of heaviness, or nagging low back pain. It can be incredibly frustrating, leaving you wondering what you’re doing wrong. The answer might not be in the exercises you’re doing, but in what you’re doing for the other 23 hours of the day: your posture.</p>
<p>Your posture is the framework upon which your entire core and pelvic floor system operates. If that framework is misaligned, your muscles are forced to work from a position of constant disadvantage. A slouching posture doesn’t just look bad; it actively compresses your core, puts relentless downward pressure on your pelvic organs, and can either overstretch or over-tighten your pelvic floor muscles, rendering your exercises far less effective.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: improving your posture is a form of passive, all-day pelvic floor therapy. It creates the optimal environment for your muscles to heal, strengthen, and function as they were designed. This guide will explain the critical link between how you sit and stand and your pelvic health, and provide simple, actionable steps to fix your alignment and unlock better results.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-canister-why-alignment-is-everything">The Core Canister: Why Alignment is Everything</h2>
<p>To understand the impact of posture, you must first understand the structure of your “true core.” It’s not just your abs; it’s a dynamic, 360-degree canister designed to manage pressure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Top:</strong> Your diaphragm.</li>
<li><strong>The Bottom:</strong> Your pelvic floor.</li>
<li><strong>The Walls:</strong> Your deep abdominals (transverse abdominis) and back muscles (multifidus).</li>
</ul>
<p>For this canister to work properly, it needs to be stacked. Imagine two bowls, one representing your rib cage and one representing your pelvis, balanced perfectly on top of each other. This is <strong>neutral alignment</strong>. In this position, when you breathe, the diaphragm and pelvic floor can move in their natural, piston-like rhythm. When you lift or cough, the pressure is distributed evenly, and the walls and base of the canister can engage effectively to provide support.</p>
<h2 id="common-postural-mistakes-and-how-they-harm-your-pelvic-floor">Common Postural Mistakes and How They Harm Your Pelvic Floor</h2>
<p>Most of us fall into one of two common non-optimal postures, both of which disrupt the canister and create problems.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-slump-swayback-or-thoracic-kyphosis">1. The “Slump”: Swayback or Thoracic Kyphosis</h3>
<p>This is the classic slouch, common in people who sit at desks all day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it looks like:</strong> The upper back is rounded, the head juts forward, the ribs are angled down, and the pelvis is often tucked under (a posterior tilt).</li>
<li><strong>The Impact:</strong> This posture compresses the front of the canister. Your diaphragm can’t descend fully, leading to shallow chest breathing. The constant pressure is directed downwards and backwards onto your tailbone and the back of your pelvic floor. This can lead to overstretched and weak muscles at the front (contributing to leaks) and tight, painful muscles at the back (contributing to tailbone pain and constipation).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-the-arch-lumbar-lordosis">2. The “Arch”: Lumbar Lordosis</h3>
<p>This posture is common in athletes, dancers, or during pregnancy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it looks like:</strong> The lower back has an excessive curve, the ribs flare upwards, and the pelvis tilts forward (an anterior tilt), making the buttocks stick out.</li>
<li><strong>The Impact:</strong> This compresses the back of the canister. It puts immense pressure on the lower back joints and forces the abdominal muscles into a constantly lengthened and weakened state. The pelvic floor is also tilted, putting extra strain on the front portion that supports the bladder, which can contribute to stress incontinence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In both scenarios, the piston is broken. The diaphragm and pelvic floor are no longer aligned and cannot work together. You are fighting against a misaligned system, which is why your exercises might not be working.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="finding-neutral-your-guide-to-better-alignment">Finding Neutral: Your Guide to Better Alignment</h2>
<p>Correcting your posture isn’t about standing rigidly straight like a soldier. It’s about finding a relaxed, efficient, and balanced alignment that allows your muscles to do their job properly.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-find-neutral-standing">How to Find Neutral Standing:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Stand with your feet hip-width apart.</li>
<li>Imagine a string pulling you up from the crown of your head, elongating your spine.</li>
<li>Place one hand on your chest and one on your pubic bone. Your goal is to have these two points aligned vertically, one on top of the other.</li>
<li>Gently rock your pelvis forward and back, finding the middle ground where your weight is balanced evenly over your feet. Your ribs should feel like they are “floating” directly over your hips.</li>
<li>Relax your shoulders down and back, away from your ears.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-to-find-neutral-sitting">How to Find Neutral Sitting:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sit on the edge of your chair and feel for the two bony points in your bottom. These are your “sitz bones.” You should be sitting directly on top of them.</li>
<li>Ensure your feet are flat on the floor, with your knees at roughly a 90-degree angle.</li>
<li>Stack your ribs over your hips, just as you did when standing. Avoid slouching back onto your tailbone or arching your low back.</li>
<li>Imagine your head floating up towards the ceiling, creating space in your neck.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="living-in-neutral-integrating-better-posture-into-your-day">Living in Neutral: Integrating Better Posture into Your Day</h2>
<p>Finding neutral is the first step; learning to live there is the goal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>At Your Desk:</strong> Set a timer to remind you to check your posture every 30 minutes. Adjust your chair and monitor height to support a neutral spine.</li>
<li><strong>While Walking:</strong> Think “tall and proud.” Imagine a helium balloon attached to the top of your head, gently lifting you upwards.</li>
<li><strong>Lifting and Carrying:</strong> Before you lift, find your neutral alignment. Engage your core on the exhale as you lift, maintaining a straight back. When carrying a child or heavy bag, hold it close to your center and avoid jutting one hip out.</li>
</ul>
<p>By making these small, conscious adjustments throughout your day, you are creating an environment where your pelvic floor can finally function optimally. You are removing the constant, low-level strain and allowing the work you do in your 5-minute daily routine to have a much more powerful and lasting effect.</p> </div> <!-- THIS IS THE MISSING STEP --> <div class="app-cta-card p-6 rounded-2xl text-center my-12 scroll-animation glass-card" data-astro-cid-tqcoi4xv> <img src="/logo.png" alt="Pelvi Health App Icon" class="h-16 w-16 mx-auto rounded-2xl shadow-lg" data-astro-cid-tqcoi4xv> <h4 class="font-bold text-white mt-4 text-xl" data-astro-cid-tqcoi4xv>Your Personal AI Physio-Coach</h4> <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 max-w-xs mx-auto" data-astro-cid-tqcoi4xv>Stop leaks, pain & intimacy issues with a 5-min daily plan built for you.</p> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pelvic-floor-core-coach/id6642654729" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="block cta-button text-white font-semibold py-3 px-5 rounded-full text-base mt-4 w-full max-w-xs mx-auto" data-astro-cid-tqcoi4xv>
