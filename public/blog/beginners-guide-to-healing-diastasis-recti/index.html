<p>Months or even years after giving birth, you look in the mirror and see that your abdomen still looks… different. There might be a persistent bulge, a “pooch” that no amount of dieting or exercise seems to touch. When you try to do a sit-up, you might notice a strange coning or doming shape down the midline of your stomach. This is the hallmark sign of <strong>Diastasis Recti</strong>, and it’s far more than a cosmetic issue.</p>
<p>Diastasis Recti is a separation of the rectus abdominis muscles (your “six-pack” muscles). It’s an incredibly common result of pregnancy, affecting a majority of women. It’s not a sign of failure or that you’re “broken”; it’s a natural adaptation your body made to accommodate your growing baby. However, when this separation doesn’t heal on its own, it can lead to a host of functional problems, including core weakness, nagging low back pain, and even pelvic floor dysfunction.</p>
<p>The good news is that with the right knowledge and exercises, you can safely and effectively heal your core. This guide will teach you how to check for diastasis recti, what exercises to avoid, and the foundational techniques to rebuild a strong, functional, and confident core.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-diastasis-recti">What Exactly is Diastasis Recti?</h2>
<p>Imagine your two rectus abdominis muscles as two pillars running vertically down the front of your abdomen. They are joined together by a strong, fibrous band of connective tissue called the <strong>linea alba</strong>. During pregnancy, a combination of hormonal changes (which soften connective tissue) and the physical pressure of the growing uterus causes the linea alba to stretch sideways, allowing the two muscle pillars to separate.</p>
<p>This separation is normal and necessary. The problem arises when, after delivery, the linea alba remains overstretched and lax, and the muscles don’t return to their original position. The key thing to understand is that diastasis recti is not a “hole” in your stomach; it’s a problem of <strong>impaired tension</strong> in the connective tissue. The goal of healing is not just to close the gap, but to restore the integrity and tension of the linea alba so it can effectively transfer force and support your core.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-check-for-diastasis-recti-at-home">How to Check for Diastasis Recti at Home</h2>
<p>You can perform a simple self-check to assess your abdominal wall. It’s best to do this when your muscles are relaxed.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lie on your back</strong> with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor.</li>
<li><strong>Place your fingertips</strong> (pointing towards your toes) on your midline at your belly button.</li>
<li><strong>Gently lift your head and shoulders</strong> off the floor, just enough to feel your abdominal muscles engage. Don’t do a full sit-up.</li>
<li><strong>Feel for the Gap:</strong> As your muscles tense, you will feel the firm edges of your rectus abdominis muscles on either side of your fingers. Assess two things:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Width:</strong> How many fingers can you fit horizontally in the gap between the muscles? A gap of more than two finger-widths is typically considered a diastasis.</li>
<li><strong>The Depth/Tension:</strong> More importantly, what does the tissue under your fingers feel like? Is it firm and springy like a trampoline, or is it soft and deep, like you can sink your fingers in easily? A lack of tension is a key indicator that the core needs rehabilitation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Check in Multiple Locations:</strong> Repeat the check a few inches above your belly button and a few inches below it, as the separation can vary along the midline.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-1-rule-what-not-to-do-with-diastasis-recti">The #1 Rule: What NOT to Do with Diastasis Recti</h2>
<p>Before we talk about what to do, it’s critical to understand what to avoid. Performing the wrong exercises can increase intra-abdominal pressure and actually make the separation worse.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid any exercise that causes your abdomen to “cone” or “dome.”</strong> This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional crunches and sit-ups</li>
<li>Full frontal planks (initially)</li>
<li>Double leg lifts</li>
<li>Any movement that causes you to hold your breath and bear down.</li>
</ul>
<p>This coning is a visual sign that the pressure inside your core is too great for the weakened linea alba to handle, and it’s bulging outwards.</p>
<h2 id="healing-your-core-the-foundational-steps">Healing Your Core: The Foundational Steps</h2>
<p>Healing diastasis recti is about rebuilding your deep core from the inside out. It starts with reconnecting your brain to the right muscles and coordinating them with your breath.</p>
<h3 id="1-re-establish-the-breath-core-connection">1. Re-establish the Breath-Core Connection</h3>
<p>As we’ve discussed in our other articles, the foundation is <strong>diaphragmatic breathing</strong>. When you inhale, your belly should expand and your pelvic floor should relax. When you exhale, your belly should gently draw in and your pelvic floor should lift. This is the natural rhythm that engages your deep core, including the all-important <strong>Transverse Abdominis (TVA)</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="2-activate-your-transverse-abdominis-tva">2. Activate Your Transverse Abdominis (TVA)</h3>
<p>The TVA is your body’s natural corset and the key to healing diastasis. Its job is to create tension across the linea alba, which helps to bring the two sides of the rectus abdominis closer together. The best way to activate it is on the exhale. As you breathe out, gently draw your lower belly button in towards your spine without moving your pelvis or rib cage.</p>
<h3 id="3-start-with-core-safe-exercises">3. Start with Core-Safe Exercises</h3>
<p>Once you’ve re-established the breath and TVA connection, you can begin to integrate it into gentle, safe movements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heel Slides:</strong> Lie on your back with knees bent. Exhale to engage your TVA, then slowly slide one heel away from you until your leg is straight. Inhale as you slide it back. The goal is to keep your torso perfectly still.</li>
<li><strong>Bent Knee Fallouts:</strong> Lie on your back with knees bent. Exhale to engage your TVA, then slowly let one knee fall out to the side, keeping your pelvis level. Inhale as you bring it back to the center.</li>
<li><strong>Glute Bridges:</strong> Lie on your back with knees bent. Exhale, engage your TVA, and lift your hips off the floor by squeezing your glutes. Inhale as you lower with control.</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on these deep, stabilizing exercises, you are teaching your core to function as an integrated system again. You are rebuilding the tension in your midline, which not only helps to close the gap but also restores the strength and stability you need to move through life with confidence.</p> </div> <!-- THIS IS THE MISSING STEP --> <div class="app-cta-card p-6 rounded-2xl text-center my-12 scroll-animation glass-card" data-astro-cid-tqcoi4xv> <img src="/logo.png" alt="Pelvi Health App Icon" class="h-16 w-16 mx-auto rounded-2xl shadow-lg" data-astro-cid-tqcoi4xv> <h4 class="font-bold text-white mt-4 text-xl" data-astro-cid-tqcoi4xv>Your Personal AI Physio-Coach</h4> <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 max-w-xs mx-auto" data-astro-cid-tqcoi4xv>Stop leaks, pain & intimacy issues with a 5-min daily plan built for you.</p> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pelvic-floor-core-coach/id6642654729" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="block cta-button text-white font-semibold py-3 px-5 rounded-full text-base mt-4 w-full max-w-xs mx-auto" data-astro-cid-tqcoi4xv>
